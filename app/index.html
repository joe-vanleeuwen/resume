                <h3>About</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>My interest in computer programming began early. My brother dabbled in programming and I was quite amazed when he drew a circle with code. As a senior in high school I took my first programming course and enjoyed every minute, though I pursued a Graphic Design degree in college. I graduated having a Humanities degree under my belt and rather unsure of what to do next. </p>
                <p>While doing manufacturing work at BMW as a Production Associate, I began to reignite my interest in programming by taking lessons in Javascript from Codeacademy. When I heard about The Iron Yard Academy's Front End Engineering course, I took the plunge and have no regrets. Now I do freelance web development work and enjoy some serious Javascript coding for fun.</p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>I learned a lot at <a href="http://theironyard.com/" target="_blank">The Iron Yard</a> during the intensive 3-month <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/front-end-engineering/" target="_blank">Front End Engineering</a> course. We hit the ground running with HTML/CSS and then dived into Javascript, building out web apps with Backbone.js and using Parse as a backend. I worked on two group projects using Git for version control. For my final project at The Iron Yard, I was able to write a difficult program using Backbone.js, Underscore.js, jQuery, and a plugin called Draggabilly. The <a href="https://github.com/joe-vanleeuwen/chess.js" target="_blank">project</a> successfully implements all the rules of chess and is well tested.</p>

                <h3>Freelance</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Since graduating from The Iron Yard Academy, I have had the opportunity to work on a number of freelance projects. I am quite new to freelance, having never done anything like it before, but I find that I enjoy freelancing.</p>

                <strong class="block"><a href="https://github.com/joe-vanleeuwen/sidebar" target="_blank">Sidebar</a></strong>
                <p>A local startup needed help with a custom sidebar. I used Backbone.js views to tackle the problem, but looking back I realize that was overkill.</p>

                <strong class="block"><a href="https://github.com/joe-vanleeuwen/overwhelmed" target="_blank">Overwhelmed</a></strong>
                <p>NewSpring Church needed to outsource the HTML/CSS portion of a website they were building for Perry Noble's new book <span class="italic">Overwhelmed</span>. Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.</p>

                <strong class="block"><a href="https://github.com/joe-vanleeuwen/envision" target="_blank">Envision</a></strong>
                <p>A Clemson grad student needed a way to test whether default settings on a form would affect a person's choice. I built out the form with the necessary functionality and used Parse to record his test administered to 150+ students.</p>
